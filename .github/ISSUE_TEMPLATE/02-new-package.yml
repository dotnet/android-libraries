        New package bindings are prioritized based on demand.  Before filing
        this issue, use this link to see if the package has already been requested:

        https://github.com/xamarin/AndroidX/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Anew-package-request

        If there is already an issue for the desired package, add a +1 emoji reaction
        to the issue to vote for the issue instead of filing this one.

        If there is no existing issue, go ahead and file this issue.

        Note that, in general, we only bind *stable* packages. We do not bind pre-release packages.
