        Note that this template rarely needs to be used. We have an automated process that runs periodically
        that files a PR to update the packages to the latest *stable* releases from Google.

        It may take a few weeks to get new versions committed and released.

        Note that, in general, we only bind *stable* versions. We do not bind pre-release package versions.
