## Java Library

| | |
|-|-|
| **Group ID** | com.google.guava |
| **Artifact ID** | failureaccess |
| **Version** | 1.0.2 |
| **License(s)** | [The Apache Software License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt) |
| **Description** | &#xA;    Contains&#xA;    com.google.common.util.concurrent.internal.InternalFutureFailureAccess and&#xA;    InternalFutures. Most users will never need to use this artifact. Its&#xA;    classes are conceptually a part of Guava, but they&#x27;re in this separate&#xA;    artifact so that Android libraries can use them without pulling in all of&#xA;    Guava (just as they can use ListenableFuture by depending on the&#xA;    listenablefuture artifact).&#xA;   |
