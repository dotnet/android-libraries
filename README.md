Microsoft creates and maintains .NET for Android bindings for many of [Google's AndroidX libraries](https://developer.android.com/jetpack).

Support for Xamarin.Android ended on [May 1st, 2024](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/xamarin). New versions of these packages will not support Xamarin.Android.

## What is AndroidX

[AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) (also called Jetpack) is a suite of libraries that developers can use to access Android functionality using best practices that work consistently across Android versions and devices.

AndroidX is a replacement for Google's original Android Support Library which is [no longer maintained](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx). 

## Binding Policies

- This repository binds over 200 AndroidX libraries that are published to [NuGet.org](https://nuget.org). The full 
  package list can be found in [config.json](config.json).
- AndroidX Java artifacts and some dependencies come from [Google's Maven Respository](https://maven.google.com/web/index.html#).
- Additional dependencies come from [Maven/Sonatype Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/).
- Google's release notes for AndroidX libraries are available [here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/versions/stable-channel).
- The major/minor/patch version numbers mirror the bound AndroidX library version. For example, the NuGet `Xamarin.AndroidX.Core 1.3.2.1` 
  binds version `1.3.2` of the AndroidX library `androidx.core:core`.
  - The revision version number is used when a new NuGet needs to be built but the AndroidX library has not been updated.
- We endeavor to release updated NuGets within a few weeks after new AndroidX releases, however large changes occasionally require 
  more time.
- In general, we do not bind pre-release libraries. As their API is not stable yet, it results in too much rework.

## Support

For tutorials/samples/support using the libraries themselves, please refer to [Google's documentation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack).
