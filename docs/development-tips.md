# Development Tips

This is a collection of tasks you might want to do in this repository, and how to do them.

## Updating Packages

Initially, run:

```bash
dotnet cake -t:update-config
```

Which will lookup Java Maven dependencies and update the `config.json` file
with the latest versions.

## Tagging and Releasing

When ready to release, tag a commit such as:

```bash
git tag 20250602-weekly-stable-updates-20250602
git push upstream 20250602-weekly-stable-updates-20250602
```

The second date can just be used if you need to push again with the
same set of bindings.

Use the [AndroidX Push NuGet.org pipeline][androidx-pipeline] and
select a specific build via `Resources > AndroidX`.

## Bumping Versions

In the case of [#1118][1118], we introduced `net10.0-android` target
framework to better support trimming and NativeAOT scenarios.

This means that many of the packages *changed*, but the Maven artifact
did not change. The NuGet packages here use the fourth component of
the version number to indicate this, so you can bump the version of
the NuGet package without changing the Maven artifact.

To "bump" the fourth component of the version number, you can run:

```bash
dotnet cake --target=bump-config
```

You should see the changes to `config.json`, noticing that none of the
`dependencyOnly=true` entries have been changed.

## Releasing Preview Packages

.NET MAUI was using version `1.1.0.3-alpha07` of
Xamarin.AndroidX.Security.SecurityCrypto, but main is building
`1.0.0.26`.

The versions of the Java packages are:

* https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/androidx.security/security-crypto/1.0.0
* https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/androidx.security/security-crypto/1.1.0-alpha07

To release a preview package, I created a [androidx.security][androidx.security]
branch with the new version and tagged it (such as `git tag
20250606-androidx.security-20250606`) as mentioned above.

Then I released the package using the [AndroidX Push NuGet.org
pipeline][androidx-pipeline] and selected the appropriate branch by
selecting a specific build via `Resources > AndroidX`.
