which contains information about various build tools repository depends on.

Items currently included are 

*   dotnet, 

*   Android SDK and NDK packages,

*   Open JDK, 

*   Mono MDK, 

*   various tools (`brew`)


## Build

AndroidX (AX) and GooglePlayServices-Firebase-MLKit (GPS-FB-MLKit) repositories are built and signed
on Azure DevOps infrastructure with `ci` Cake (Cake build tool default `build.cake` script) target.

Build stages:

1.  on CI servers 

    2 stages

    1.   target `ci`

    2.   `api-diff` as default target (`nuget-api-diff` in `nuget-diff.cake`)

        `api-diff` is not target, script is executed

2. local builds have additional script `utilities.cake`

    1.  namespace naming verification (dotnettification/dotnetifying java package names)

    2.  spell checking (nugets, and namespaces)

    3.  report generation

    4.  other

        there are several tools in early preview 

### Versions

*   CI Builds

    All tools are installed from scratch, so the latest versions are used (nuget semver `*`)

*   local builds

    It depends on team members. 
    
    Due to dogfooding user `@moljac` uses previews (nuget semver `*_*`)
